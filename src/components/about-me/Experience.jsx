            During my final semester, I took up an off-campus internship as a Frontend Intern at 7 Dots Smart Solutions for 6 months. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After I graduated, I joined them full-time as a Software Developer
            <br />
            <br />
            Ever since, I have been building scalable applications and websites while gaining significant experience in Backend too.
